<h1>Bitcoin Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this project I build a machine learnin model that can predicts the price the bitcoin using previous data of the 2024 year. Also This model is capable to give the result of a news and what does it consider for Bitcoin price change using sentiment analysis.</p>

<ul><h3>Skills used:</h3>
  <li>Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Data clean</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<ol><h3>Steps:</h3>
  <li>To emplement this project I had to supply it with data. So I use Kaggle website and download 2 data sets for bitcoin.</li>
  <li>First I had to find a column that is common in both so i changed the date column to datetime and merge the columns</li>
  <li>Then I had to clean the columns and change their data types and create some new features</li>
  <li>After that I used the cleaned data and supply it to machine learning file to build the model. </li>
  <li>In the ml file i wrote some functions that can: Craete a df, train the model, test it's score, and predict the user input. Both for price prediction or sentiment analysis</li>
</ol>

<ul><h3>Running File:</h3>
  <li>The file is ready to run it predict the sentiment analysis and dives the score of accuracy of the price model</li>
  <li>You can set any input you want or use to predict the price</li>
  <li>to run: python ml.py</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Here I Load the data and merge them</p>

<p>Here is some functions that change the text to nb inorder the ml to understand and a function to test the score</p>

<p>Here I decode the The result of the prediction to write the sentiment and print the results</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>This project was done by me Hussein ghandour. The aim of this project is to train me to real life tasks regarding data analysis and machine learning. And programmer can explore the files and use them or tain and develop thier skills with me.</p>
